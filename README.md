# nodemailx
CLI for SENDING emails based on portable config files.
The aim is to be able to copy-paste the distribution together with a config file and use it on any system connected to the network without needing a system administrator to locally configure sendmail.

The functionality refers only to the sending of emails. This program cannot read mails and cannot use previously send mail files.
It should generally be used in scripts.
